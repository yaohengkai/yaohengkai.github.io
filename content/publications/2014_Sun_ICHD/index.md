abstract: Rossby Wave is asort of planetary-scale wave with major influence in marine science and atmospheric science. It has long wavelength and propagates slowly. People can only study it through statistics from altimeter and other satellite remote sensing technology and lack intuition acknowledgement. This article is based on preceding experiments. We strive for some measures onimitating Rossby wave in the lab and testing oceanic eddy, as well as some experience on how toimitate Rossby wave more accurately. The experiment is performed on OUC earth rotation experiment table. Beta plane simulated variation on Coriolis parameter approximately by designing cone and square rotation tanks with several slopes. By controlling the rotation speed of the tank, we can imitate westward transmission process. We can also imitate it by placing different obstacles to create waves as well as changing slopes of cone to stimulate submarine topography. We observed the effect of different obstacles on formation and disappearing, motion curve and shape of Rossby wave. Staining and PIV method are adopted in the experiment to show shape and distributionof Rossby wave.
