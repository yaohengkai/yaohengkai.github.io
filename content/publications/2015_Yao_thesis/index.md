abstract: |-
  In this paper, 1945--2012 years seawater temperature and salinity data analysis of the vertical structure of temperature and salinity, heat content, temperature and salinity. The results show a significant seasonal variation in the surface. 1945-1997, the presence of the upper ocean heat content significant period 181 months and a clear downward trend; in 1997-2000 Heat Content abnormal increase; since 2000, the upper heat content appear more significant decline. Wherein the heat content anomalies begin in May 1997.
  Through various features of time series analysis of the annual variation of the Nordic seawater, Low frequency NAO modulation may change the effects on high-frequency variations of upper heat content of annual variation of surface and subsurface temperature. It is found in the lower continually rise in global warming hiatus phenomenon, there is a clear warming trend after 2000 in mid-water, which lagged behind the NAO phase phase for about eight years.
  Vertical distribution of temperature and salinity show 1945-2012 Greenland basin salinity mainly negative anomaly, and Norwegian Lofoten Basin and the basin first fades and then salty trend, which is usually down to the depth of the Lofoten Basin 700m.
